worst application. 1. No on time delivery. 2. A huge amount was deducted in the name of tax 3. No healthy respect towards customers.
Uses dark patterns to consistently make you use the app. Tries to incentivize the user to auto add money if balance goes below a certain amount via offering so called 'cashbacks'. Much like how gambling apps operate, this app preys on the unhealthy whims of modern fast food and chews away slowly at both a customer's health and wealth. Oh, and they don't even let you change your phone number. It is no better than a gambling app that masquerades as a food delivery service.
There needs to be some standards and compliance set to add restaurants on your app. Back to back I am getting worst quality, unhygienic and unhealthy food delivered. Surprisingly all of them had 4+ ratings.
zomato never aknowledge me about grouping of orders, they assign a deliver partner for delivery of my food , and he picked my food and he gets another order from another restaurent, he goes to another restaurent and wait there for that another order while my food in his bag , that going to cooled and getting unhealthy every second, i refused to accept this order but zomato forced me to accept this unhealthy food and they refused to give me my money back or cancel this order. they should keep som
if there is a chance to give 0 I will definitely ready to give. worst app delivering unhealthy food to customers and worst of the worst response also. my brother got sick due to food poision. I'm filing case on this. don't order food and don't waste your money 😡
Very bad experience with app and customer support. Customer support refused to help when I received unhealthy burnt food even when I provided them necessary proof of Videos and photos. Will never use Zomato again and I don't recommend this to friends and family. And slow delivery, worst experience.
cheating, no hygiene restaurant. for all restaurants they use the same picture. and it's costly, quantity is very less. we are paying high prices for small quantities. don't be fooled with the food picture and fake reviews in app. and to avoid order in the restaurant most of the chef are prepared by unhealthy foods. too much they use salt and oil
They are clubbing the orders with other orders and delaying the delivery. yesterday i ordered food from a restaurant which us just 3km away from my home. Delivery boy picked the order in 15mins time but delivered the product after 1 hour. When inquired, i was told that they scheduled him another delivery on his way. The food lost it's ideal temperature and they served food unhealthy manner. Worst app, so I started using swiggy instead
This is one of worst app ever when it comes to food delivery time and hours! It's never matching with the time mentioned on the apps it may mentioned 45 minutes but the food will always arrived after 1 hour 30 minutes or more than that! Given fake commitment and fake times when at the time food gets delivered the food will be really cold especially the rolls or the sandwich or wrap from @fresh menu @mcdonalds foods better to go physically and go and eat! I know eating food outside is not healthy
Worst of worst experiences you people why do you dare to start Instamart it's big fraud by you, selling rotten and spoiled foods and making us unhealthy
Zomato gives me un healthy poor hygenic food Very bad experience

No single restaurant make the freshly food all restaurants used preserved or stored food items like gravies and all they make too much oily food like dal sambar paneer sabjis each and every food items its a great disappointment from my side foods are totally un healthy they are greatly impacted on people. So keep focusing on this are. Please concern on all this things. Keep improving 👍
